<div class="hstry_cntnt">Elixir changes ownerships hands beginning of 2010. Jon Shepard, having spent a 25 year career successfully starting up and building businesses in the fitness industry and a lifelong health food advocate, purchases business assets and several locations from the founder with a business partner, due<br />
  in part to what he feels is the healthiest best tasting premium smoothie made in America! No additives, all natural, no dairy, no syrups, ice nor artificial sweeteners like sorbet or yogurt used in competitors' products. Jon and his business partner introduce a new line of healthy food options including salads, wraps, delicious sides that are hits like quinoa, barley, spa chicken and protein packs.<br />
  <br />
    Elixir takes its successful recipes developed by nutritionists of ready to press fresh juices and starts bottling and selling them at Elixir locations as well as continuing to provide ready to serve options at its Juice Bars. With input from nutritionists, dieticians, along with health and wellness experts, Elixir designs and starts offering its highly sought after 1, 3, and 5 day Juice Cleanse program by the end of 2010</p>
